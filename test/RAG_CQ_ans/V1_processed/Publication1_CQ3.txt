Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include: - **Labeling of datasets:** Analysts use the software tools to create labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning (DL) models. This involves manually reviewing and labeling data samples. - **Image annotation:** For images, the visualization consists of image cropping around the object of interest, contrast enhancement, and consecutive frame differences. This suggests that bounding box annotation or region-based annotation is used to focus on the object of interest within images. - **Audio annotation:** For audio data, 2D spectrograms are displayed per panel, and analysts can visually spot and label sounds of interest. The annotation here is based on visual and auditory inspection of spectrograms, rather than traditional bounding boxes. - **Data clustering and selection:** Tools like t-SNE are used to cluster data samples by similarity, and analysts can select and label data samples from these clusters. The context does not specifically mention instance segmentation or polygon annotation, but it does describe bounding box-like annotation (image cropping) and labeling of both audio and image data. **Summary:** The main data annotation techniques described are: - Image cropping (bounding box-like annotation) - Labeling of audio spectrograms - Manual review and labeling of data samples - Data selection and labeling via clustering tools Instance segmentation is not specifically mentioned in the provided context.
