Based on the provided context, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not specified as being available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context mentions a Bloomberg data link (http://first. bloomberglp. com/documents/d4gx/Environment. zip), but it does not explicitly state that this is the repository for the deep learning pipeline data. Therefore, I don't know where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available.
