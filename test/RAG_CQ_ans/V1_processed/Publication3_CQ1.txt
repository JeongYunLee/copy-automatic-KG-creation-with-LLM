Based on the provided context, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study were collected from the following sources: - Public datasets: Specifically, data were obtained from the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Library of Natural Sounds, which provided recordings of Platymantis species. - Field surveys: Additional recordings were generated from recent field surveys conducted by researchers (e. g. , RMB and colleagues). There is no mention of the use of sensors (other than audio recording devices implied by the collection of frog calls) or surveys in the traditional sense (e. , questionnaires). The primary methods described are the use of public datasets and field- collected audio recordings.
