The purpose of the deep learning model described in the context is primarily classification and detection. The models are used to classify the presence or absence and activity rates of different endangered species, as well as to detect specific events of interest (such as the sounds of birds colliding with energy infrastructure) in audio spectrogram and image data. The models output the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class, usually corresponding to a species or event.
