The provided context does not specify the exact strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training. It describes the use of labeled datasets to train and refine deep learning (DL) models, manual review and auditing of model outputs, and periodic A/B testing of user interface improvements, but it does not detail the specific methods or metrics used to monitor model performance during the training process itself.
