The provided context does not give a detailed, step-by-step list of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that analysts use tools for data exploration to sort and filter data according to various attributes (e. g. , date ranges, time of day, site location, frequency ranges for audio, object size and color for images). This suggests that some level of data organization and selection is performed before model training. Additionally, labeled datasets are created to train and refine deep learning models, which implies that data labeling and possibly cleaning (to ensure correct labels) are part of the process. In summary, while the context implies that data exploration, filtering, and labeling are important preprocessing steps, it does not explicitly mention standard preprocessing techniques like normalization or scaling.
