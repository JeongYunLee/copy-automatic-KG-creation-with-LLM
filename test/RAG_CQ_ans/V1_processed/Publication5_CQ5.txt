The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are: - MOD13A1 and MYD13A1: 16-day composite NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) products at a resolution of 15 arcseconds. - MCD15A2: 8-day composite LAI (Leaf Area Index) product at 15 arcseconds, converted to 16-day composites. - Species richness data from the Korea Forest Serviceâ€™s 6th National Forest Inventory and Monitoring. These datasets were used to estimate plant species richness across the Korean Peninsula. The data were downloaded from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Standard image datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were not used in this pipeline.
