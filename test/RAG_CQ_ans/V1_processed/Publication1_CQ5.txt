The context does not specify the use of standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline for biodiversity monitoring. Instead, it describes the use of large amounts of labeled data produced by analysts using their own user interface, including audio spectrogram and image data collected from sensor networks for classifying species signals and event types. These datasets are specific to the biodiversity monitoring projects and are not standard public datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
