The following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model: 1. **Transfer Learning**: The study used transfer learning with the Inception v3 model, which was pre- trained on over 1 million images from the ImageNet database. This approach leverages knowledge from a large, diverse dataset to improve performance on the new task. 2. **Leave-One-Out Cross Validation**: Due to the limited number of images per species (n = 20), the researchers used a leave-one-out cross validation technique to evaluate model performance in several classification challenges. This method helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data. 3. **Testing on Unseen Species**: In Challenge 2, the model was tested on species not present in the reference library to evaluate its ability to handle novel classes and to assess certainty rates for unknown versus known species. 4. **Faunal Region-Based Subsets**: In Challenge 4, the researchers created subsets of species based on their distribution across different Philippine islands, generating separate classification tasks with varying numbers of classes. This approach simulates more realistic, local species pools and tests the modelâ€™s generalizability across different ecological communities. 5. **Validation Percentage Adjustment**: The validation parameter was increased to 20% due to the small sample size, ensuring a larger portion of data was used for validation during training. However, the study notes that the limited number of recordings per species was a challenge, and suggests that future studies should use more recordings and, if possible, k-fold cross-validation for even better generalizability.
