The provided context does not mention the use of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the input data for the model consists of MODIS-derived NDVI and LAI time-series data at each pixel location, and the output is the corresponding species richness value derived from S-SDMs. There is no reference to manual annotation techniques like bounding boxes or segmentation masks.
