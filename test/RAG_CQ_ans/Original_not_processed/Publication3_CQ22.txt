Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning
model (TensorFlow/Inception v3) include:  1. **Correct identification rate (accuracy)**: This is the
primary metric reported, representing the percentage of images correctly identified by the model for
each species and overall.  2. **Average certainty rate**: This refers to the average confidence
(certainty) score assigned by the model to its predictions for each species.  There is no mention in
the provided context of using precision, recall, or F1-score as evaluation metrics. The focus is on
correct identification rate (accuracy) and average certainty rate.
