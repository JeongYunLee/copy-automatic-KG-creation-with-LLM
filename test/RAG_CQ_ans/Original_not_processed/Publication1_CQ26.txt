The provided context does not specifically mention techniques such as stratified splitting,
oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used to address data bias during
preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on data exploration, labeling, and
the use of deep learning models for classification and detection, but does not detail specific
methods for handling data bias in preprocessing.
