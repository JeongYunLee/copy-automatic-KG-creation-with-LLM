The provided context does not specify the exact hyperparameters (such as learning rate or optimizer)
used in the deep learning models for biodiversity monitoring. It describes the use of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep feed forward neural networks (DNNs), but does not
detail the specific hyperparameter settings.
