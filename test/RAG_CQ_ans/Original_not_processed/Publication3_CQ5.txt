The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are spectrogram images
generated from audio recordings of frog calls, specifically from the genus Platymantis. The
recordings were sourced from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology Macaulay Library and recent field
surveys. The spectrograms were created using R packages warbleR and Seewave, and each spectrogram
represents a single call note from a Platymantis species. There is no mention of standard image
datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used for the classification tasks; instead, the
pipeline uses custom datasets of spectrograms derived from bioacoustic recordings.
