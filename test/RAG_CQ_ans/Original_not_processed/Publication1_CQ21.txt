The provided context does not give a detailed, explicit list of postprocessing steps such as
saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after model training. However, it does
mention some relevant postprocessing and auditing activities:  - **Manual Review and Auditing:**
After running deep learning (DL) models to classify and detect species or events of interest,
analysts manually review and audit the output. The model outputs the relative probability that an
event is from a specific data class, and analysts can sort and review the data accordingly. -
**Visualization Tools:** Analysts use visualization tools such as 2D scatter plots, heat maps, and
t-SNE clustering to view and select data samples according to similarity or multiple attributes.
This helps in identifying common signal types or anomalies. - **Labeling and Auditing UI:** The user
interface allows analysts to efficiently label and audit data samples, using visualizations like
spectrograms for audio and enhanced images for visual data. Keyboard shortcuts and batch processing
are used to increase throughput. - **Efficacy Testing:** The efficacy of UI improvements is
periodically tested using A/B testing to measure improvements in audit throughput.  The context does
not specifically mention the use of saliency maps, metrics calculation (such as accuracy, precision,
recall), or confusion matrices as postprocessing steps, but it does describe a process of manual and
semi-automated review, visualization, and auditing of model outputs.  **In summary:**   The
postprocessing steps described in the context primarily involve manual review and auditing of model
outputs using visualization and labeling tools, as well as sorting and filtering based on model
probabilities and data attributes. Specific mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or
confusion matrices is not provided in the context.
