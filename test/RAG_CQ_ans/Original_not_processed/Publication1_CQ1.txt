The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include:  - **Sensors:**
Inexpensive, programmable mobile phones and off-the-shelf sensor hardware equipped with data
transmission radios and on-board processing capabilities are used to gather and telemeter sensor
data from the field. These sensors can collect high-bit-rate datasets such as audio (e.g., 16-bit
stereo audio at 22 kHz) and images (e.g., 2048-by-1536 color images taken every thirty seconds). -
**Visual Sensor Networks:** Images are collected by satellites, airplanes, wave gliders, and
unmanned aerial vehicles to track changes at the landscape scale. - **Communication Networks:**
Sensors are configured in a communication network, enabling data to flow from remote areas to
accessible base stations, which then transmit data via internet, satellite, microwave, or cell
networks, or act as data-loggers. - **Surveys:** Data is collected at multiple monitoring sites,
often with a 30% duty cycle over each day, and can generate large volumes of data (e.g., more than 5
GB per day per survey point). - **Other Environmental Sensors:** Additional data such as temperature
or air quality is collected, though at much lower data rates.  There is no mention of using public
datasets in the provided context.
