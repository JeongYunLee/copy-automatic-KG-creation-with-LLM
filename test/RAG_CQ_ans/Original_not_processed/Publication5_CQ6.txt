Based on the provided context, the following preprocessing steps were involved before training the
deep learning model:  1. **Data Compilation and Selection**: MODIS-derived NDVI and LAI time-series
data were compiled for the year 2009, which was the middle year of the species survey period.  2.
**Temporal and Spatial Resampling**:    - The 8-day composite LAI product (MCD15A2) was converted to
16-day composite images to match the temporal resolution of the NDVI product.    - Both NDVI and LAI
data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 30 arcseconds to be consistent with the species
richness results.  3. **Handling Missing Values**: At each pixel location, only samples where no
missing values existed were used for model training and testing.  4. **Data Mosaicking and
Reprojection**: MODIS images from different tiles (h27v04, h27v05, h28v05) were composited and
reprojected using the MODIS Reprojection Tool to cover the entire Korean Peninsula.  The context
does not explicitly mention normalization or scaling of the input features, nor does it detail other
cleaning steps beyond handling missing values. If such steps were performed, they are not described
in the provided text.
