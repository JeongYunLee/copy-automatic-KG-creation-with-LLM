Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses the following data formats:
- **Audio**: High sample rate audio data, such as 16-bit stereo audio at 22,000 samples per second
(22 kHz), is used. Audio data is often represented as 2D spectrograms for analysis and
visualization. - **Image**: High-resolution color images, for example, 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2
color images, are collected and processed. - **Other Environmental Sensor Data**: Data such as
temperature or air quality, which typically have much lower data rates, are also mentioned.  There
is no explicit mention of video or CSV formats in the context provided.
