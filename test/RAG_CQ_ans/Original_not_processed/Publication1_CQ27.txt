The provided context does not specify the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning
model, such as details about model serialization or platform selection. It describes the use of deep
learning models for classifying sensor data and mentions the use of infrastructure like cloud
computing (e.g., AWS) for data storage and processing, but does not detail the deployment steps for
the models themselves.
