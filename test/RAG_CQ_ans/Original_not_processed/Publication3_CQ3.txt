Based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is
the creation of spectrogram images from audio recordings. Specifically, single-note audio clips from
different Platymantis species were processed to generate spectrograms, which were then used as input
images for the CNN (Inception v3) model. There is no mention of bounding box annotation, instance
segmentation, or other common image annotation techniques. The annotation in this case involves
labeling each spectrogram image with the corresponding species identity.
