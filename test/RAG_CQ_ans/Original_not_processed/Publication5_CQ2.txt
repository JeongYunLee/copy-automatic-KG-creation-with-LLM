Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses remote sensing data products (MODIS-
derived NDVI and LAI time-series) that are processed as pixel-wise inputs. These data are in the
form of raster images (composite images at specific spatial and temporal resolutions). The data are
not described as audio, video, or CSV, but rather as image data (raster format) processed for each
pixel location.  Therefore, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image
(raster) data.
