The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved modifying two
parameters of the model: (1) the number of training steps, and (2) the validation percentage. The
researchers explored different numbers of training steps to find an optimum balance between
computing time and classification efficiency. Given the limited number of images per species, they
increased the validation parameter to 20%. Additionally, they used a leave-one-out cross validation
technique to evaluate model performance in certain challenges. Certainty rates provided by
TensorFlow for each identification task were also used as a factor to evaluate classifier
performance on test images.
