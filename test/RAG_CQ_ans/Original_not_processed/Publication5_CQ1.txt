The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline described in the context
include:  - **Remote sensing sensors**: Data such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
and LAI (Leaf Area Index) are collected from remote sensing sensors, specifically MODIS (Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Other sensors mentioned that could be used include Landsat,
WorldView, and KOMPSAT. - **Public datasets**: The NDVI and LAI products used in the study were
downloaded from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). - **Surveys**:
Species richness data were obtained from survey data, such as those from the Korea Forest Serviceâ€™s
National Forest Inventory and Monitoring.  In summary, the raw data are collected using a
combination of remote sensing sensors, public datasets, and field surveys.
