Based on the provided context, the following postprocessing steps are involved after model training:
1. **Metrics Calculation**: The certainty rate (confidence score) for each classification is
calculated and used as a factor to evaluate classifier performance on test images. Average certainty
rates are also computed for groups of species (e.g., those present in the reference library vs.
those not present).  2. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is generated to visualize and
assess the model’s performance, showing how often images of each species are correctly or
incorrectly classified. The matrix includes certainty rates for each classification, with color
coding to indicate different ranges of certainty.  3. **Statistical Testing**: A Mann–Whitney U test
is used to compare certainty rates between groups (e.g., species present in the reference library
vs. new species), providing a statistical assessment of model performance differences.  There is no
mention in the provided context of using saliency maps or other model interpretability tools as part
of the postprocessing steps.  **Summary of postprocessing steps:** - Calculation of certainty rates
(metrics) - Generation and analysis of confusion matrices - Statistical comparison of performance
metrics (e.g., Mann–Whitney U test)  Saliency maps are not mentioned in the provided context.
