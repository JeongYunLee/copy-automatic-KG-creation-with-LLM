The provided context does not specifically mention techniques such as stratified splitting,
oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection being used to address data bias during
preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context does mention using leave-one-out cross
validation and adjusting the validation percentage due to limited sample sizes, as well as creating
subsets of species based on biogeographical regions to improve classification performance. However,
explicit mention of standard data bias mitigation techniques like stratified splitting,
oversampling, or undersampling is not provided in the context.
