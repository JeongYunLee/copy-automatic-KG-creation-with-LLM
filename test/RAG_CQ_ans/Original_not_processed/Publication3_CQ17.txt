The provided context does not specify any particular regularization methods (such as dropout or L2
regularization) used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline described. The text
discusses the use of transfer learning, cross-validation techniques (leave-one-out and k-fold), and
the architecture of CNNs, but does not mention explicit regularization methods.
