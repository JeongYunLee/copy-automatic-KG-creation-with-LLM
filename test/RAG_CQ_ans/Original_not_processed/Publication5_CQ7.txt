The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are as follows:  - The stacked
species richness training data for South Korea were divided into four geographical quadrants (NE,
NW, SE, SW). - For each quadrant, 4 MLPs were developed using 3 quadrants as the training set and
the remaining quadrant as the testing set (i.e., a form of spatial cross-validation). - Within the
training set, a randomly selected 20% of the training samples were used as validation data to
determine the modelsâ€™ performance and to minimize overfitting for unseen data.  In summary:   -
Training set: 3 out of 4 geographical quadrants   - Testing set: the remaining quadrant   -
Validation set: 20% randomly selected from the training set
