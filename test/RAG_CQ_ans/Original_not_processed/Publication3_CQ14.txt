Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model (specifically, the number of
training steps and the validation percentage) were modified and different numbers of training steps
were explored to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency.
However, the context does not specify the use of systematic hyperparameter optimization methods such
as grid search or random search. Instead, it suggests that the authors manually explored different
values for these parameters.  Therefore, the hyperparameters were optimized by manually exploring
different values, not by grid search or random search.
