The provided context does not specify particular measures such as diverse datasets, cross-
validation, or stratified splitting that were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep
learning model. The context does mention the use of large amounts of labeled data, the application
of deep learning models to various sensor data, and the use of tools for data exploration and
labeling, but it does not detail specific strategies for ensuring generalizability.
