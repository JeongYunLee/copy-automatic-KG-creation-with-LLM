6,"What preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning)?","The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing the images to a standard size, in this case, 128x128 pixels. This step is important as it helps in speeding up the training. In this dataset, 40479 images for training and 40669 images for testing were used. Each image may be classified into multiple classes. No preprocessing involving the texture and nature of the image itself was performed. ",True
4,"What are the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., Flipping, Rotating, Scaling)?","The paper does not provide specific details on the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that data augmentation could be performed to make the system more robust, considering that satellite images may vary in terms of lighting effect, rotation, shifting, etc. Therefore, it can be inferred that techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling could potentially be applied for data augmentation in this context.

22,"What metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)?","The following metrics were evaluated in our work: Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F-Beta Score, and Categorical Cross Entropy. ",True
17,"What are the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization)?","The paper does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, common regularization methods used in deep learning include dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and prevents overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting. ",True
